# Lab 1

The purpose of this lab was to become familiar with the GNU project C and C++
compiler (GCC), the GNU debugger (GDB), GNU Make, and makefiles. [`lab1.c`](lab1.c) and
[lab1_func.c](lab1_func.c) were given C source code that were to be passed as operands to
`gcc` to create an executable file.
