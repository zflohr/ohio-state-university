# Lab 1

The purpose of this lab was to become familiar with the GNU project C and C++
compiler (GCC), the GNU debugger (GDB), GNU Make, and makefiles.
[`lab1.c`](lab1.c), [`lab1_func.c`](lab1_func.c), and
[`local_file.h`](local_file.h) were provided by the course instructor. The C
source code was passed as operands to `gcc` to create an executable file, which
ran a program that used functions of the stdio.h header file of the C standard
library to print a description of the program to stdout, to read characters from
stdin, and to print the characters on separate lines to stdout. The important
functions involved are `printf()`, `getchar()`, and `putchar()`.
